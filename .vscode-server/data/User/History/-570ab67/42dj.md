# Hello World Application

## Description
This is a minimal Python application that prints "Hello World" to the console. The project is containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Docker Compose, and includes a CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions.

## Project Structure
```
/home/log430
├── app.py                 # Main application file
├── test_app.py            # Unit tests for the application
├── Dockerfile             # Dockerfile for containerizing the application
├── docker-compose.yml     # Docker Compose configuration
└── .github/workflows/ci.yml # GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- GitHub account for CI/CD pipeline

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Run the Application Locally
```bash
python3 app.py
```

### 2. Run Unit Tests
Install `pytest` if not already installed:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
Run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```

### 3. Build and Run with Docker
Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t hello-world-app .
```
Run the container:
```bash
docker run --rm hello-world-app
```

### 4. Orchestrate with Docker Compose
Start the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to:
- Run unit tests
- Build the Docker image
- Push the image to Docker Hub

To use the pipeline:
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Configure secrets in the repository for Docker Hub credentials:
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password
